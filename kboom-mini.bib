abstract = {The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) project, available at http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org, provides a structured, comprehensive and well-defined set of 10,088 classes (terms) describing human phenotypic abnormalities and 13,326 subclass relations between the HPO classes. In addition we have developed logical definitions for 46{\%} of all HPO classes using terms from ontologies for anatomy, cell types, function, embryology, pathology and other domains. This allows interoperability with several resources, especially those containing phenotype information on model organisms such as mouse and zebrafish. Here we describe the updated HPO database, which provides annotations of 7,278 human hereditary syndromes listed in OMIM, Orphanet and DECIPHER to classes of the HPO. Various meta-attributes such as frequency, references and negations are associated with each annotation. Several large-scale projects worldwide utilize the HPO for describing phenotype information in their datasets. We have therefore generated equivalence mappings to other phenotype vocabularies such as LDDB, Orphanet, MedDRA, UMLS and phenoDB, allowing integration of existing datasets and interoperability with multiple biomedical resources. We have created various ways to access the HPO database content using flat files, a MySQL database, and Web-based tools. All data and documentation on the HPO project can be found online.},

abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases present a wide and complex range of biological and clinical features. Animal models are key to translational research, yet typically only exhibit a subset of disease features rather than being precise replicas of the disease. Consequently, connecting animal to human conditions using direct data-mining strategies has proven challenging, particularly for diseases of the nervous system, with its complicated anatomy and physiology. To address this challenge we have explored the use of ontologies to create formal descriptions of structural phenotypes across scales that are machine processable and amenable to logical inference. As proof of concept, we built a Neurodegenerative Disease Phenotype Ontology (NDPO) and an associated Phenotype Knowledge Base (PKB) using an entity-quality model that incorporates descriptions for both human disease phenotypes and those of animal models. Entities are drawn from community ontologies made available through the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF) and qualities are drawn from the Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO). We generated {\~{}}1200 structured phenotype statements describing structural alterations at the subcellular, cellular and gross anatomical levels observed in 11 human neurodegenerative conditions and associated animal models. PhenoSim, an open source tool for comparing phenotypes, was used to issue a series of competency questions to compare individual phenotypes among organisms and to determine which animal models recapitulate phenotypic aspects of the human disease in aggregate. Overall, the system was able to use relationships within the ontology to bridge phenotypes across scales, returning non-trivial matches based on common subsumers that were meaningful to a neuroscientist with an advanced knowledge of neuroanatomy. The system can be used both to compare individual phenotypes and also phenotypes in aggregate. This proof of concept suggests that expressing complex phenotypes using formal ontologies provides considerable benefit for comparing phenotypes across scales and species.},

DO is a biomedical resource of standardized common and rare disease concepts with stable identifiers organized by disease etiology. The content of DO has had 192 revisions since 2012, including the addition of 760 terms. Thirty-two percent of all terms now include definitions. DO has expanded the number and diversity of research communities and community members by 50+ during the past two years. These community members actively submit term requests, coordinate biomedical resource disease representation and provide expert curation guidance. Since the DO 2012 NAR paper, there have been hundreds of term requests and a steady increase in the number of DO listserv members, twitter followers and DO website usage. DO is moving to a multi-editor model utilizing Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} to curate DO in web ontology language. This will enable closer collaboration with the Human Phenotype Ontology, EBI's Ontology Working Group, Mouse Genome Informatics and the Monarch Initiative among others, and enhance DO's current asserted view and multiple inferred views through reasoning.},

@article{Oti2007,
abstract = {Evidence from many sources suggests that similar phenotypes are begotten by functionally related genes. This is most obvious in the case of genetically heterogeneous diseases such as Fanconi anemia, Bardet-Biedl or Usher syndrome, where the various genes work together in a single biological module. Such modules can be a multiprotein complex, a pathway, or a single cellular or subcellular organelle. This observation suggests a number of hypotheses about the human phenome that are now beginning to be explored. First, there is now good evidence from bioinformatic analyses that human genetic diseases can be clustered on the basis of their phenotypic similarities and that such a clustering represents true biological relationships of the genes involved. Second, one may use such phenotypic similarity to predict and then test for the contribution of apparently unrelated genes to the same functional module. This concept is now being systematically tested for several diseases. Most recently, a systematic yeast two-hybrid screen of all known genes for inherited ataxias indicated that they all form part of a single extended protein-protein interaction network. Third, one can use bioinformatics to make predictions about new genes for diseases that form part of the same phenotype cluster. This is done by starting from the known disease genes and then searching for genes that share one or more functional attributes such as gene expression pattern, coevolution, or gene ontology. Ultimately, one may expect that a modular view of disease genes should help the rapid identification of additional disease genes for multifactorial diseases once the first few contributing genes (or environmental factors) have been reliably identified.},

abstract = {Most existing ontology mapping tools do not provide exact mappings. Rather, there is usually some degree of uncertainty. We describe a framework to improve existing ontology mappings using a Bayesian Network. Omen, an Ontology Mapping ENhancer uses a set of meta-rules that capture the influence of the ontology structure and the semantics of ontology relations and matches nodes that are neighbors of already matched nodes in the two ontologies. We have implemented a protype ontology matcher that can enhance existing matches between ontology concepts. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that Omen successfully identifies and enhances ontology mappings. 1},
